# Brainstorming

Transform rough ideas into fully-formed designs through structured questioning and exploration of alternatives.

## When to Use
- Starting a new project or feature
- Exploring solutions to a problem
- Planning architecture or design
- When ideas need refinement

## Process

### 1. Clarify the Core Idea
- What problem are you solving?
- Who is it for?
- What does success look like?
- What are the constraints?

### 2. Explore Alternatives
For each major decision, generate 3+ alternatives:
- The obvious solution
- The opposite approach
- Something unconventional

### 3. Challenge Assumptions
- What are we assuming is true?
- What if we removed this constraint?
- What would [expert/competitor] do?

### 4. Structure the Design
- Break into components
- Define interactions
- Identify dependencies
- Prioritize features

### 5. Validate
- Does it solve the original problem?
- Are there obvious gaps?
- What's the MVP?

## Output Format

```markdown
# Design: [Title]

## Problem Statement
[What we're solving]

## Proposed Solution
[Core approach]

## Alternatives Considered
1. [Alternative A] - [Why not chosen]
2. [Alternative B] - [Why not chosen]

## Components
1. [Component A]
   - Responsibility: [What it does]
   - Dependencies: [What it needs]
   
2. [Component B]
   - Responsibility: [What it does]
   - Dependencies: [What it needs]

## Open Questions
- [ ] [Question 1]
- [ ] [Question 2]

## Next Steps
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
```

## Tips
- Quantity over quality initially - generate many ideas
- Build on ideas, don't dismiss immediately
- Use visual diagrams when helpful
- Timebox each phase
