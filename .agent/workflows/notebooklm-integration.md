# NotebookLM Integration

Use NotebookLM for source-grounded answers based on your documents.

## What is NotebookLM?

Google's NotebookLM lets you upload documents and ask questions grounded in those specific sources.

## When to Use
- Need answers from specific documents
- Research with citations
- Analyzing uploaded materials
- Cross-referencing sources

## Workflow

Upload to NotebookLM:
- PDFs
- Google Docs
- Web pages (via URL)
- Text files

### 2. Query the Notebook

Ask questions that:
- Reference your uploaded sources
- Request specific citations
- Compare information across docs

### 3. Get Grounded Answers

NotebookLM provides:
- Answers based ONLY on your sources
- Direct citations
- Confidence indicators

## Best Use Cases

**Research:**
- "What does source X say about topic Y?"
- "Compare the approaches in these papers"

**Analysis:**
- "Summarize the key findings"
- "What are the contradictions?"

**Learning:**
- "Explain concept Z using these materials"
- "Create study notes from these chapters"

## Limitations

- Only uses uploaded sources

- Document size limits
- Processing time for large docs

## Tips

1. **Curate sources** - Quality over quantity
