## 🌟 Overview

**MilesAI (MilesOS)** is a comprehensive superapp for miles and travel focused on the American market. It combines:

- ✅ Points and miles optimization tools
- ✅ Premium education (ebooks and courses)
- ✅ Award flight search with points
- ✅ Travel hacker community
- ✅ Gamification to transform beginners into experts

### Unique Value Proposition

> "Transform everyday spending into premium travel with less cost and less time — showing in real-time what to do NOW to reach your next trip."

### Critical Differentiator

This is NOT "just another miles blog". It's an **operating system** that:

1. **DECIDES** → Cash vs points? Which card? Which transfer?
2. **EXECUTES** → Checklists, alerts, action routes
3. **TEACHES** → Micro-lessons, structured courses
4. **PROVES** → History, progress score, real results

- ❌ We're NOT bank affiliates trying to push cards
- ❌ We have NO conflicts of interest in recommendations

- ✅ We show transparent calculations
- ✅ We admit when something isn't worth it

❌ Promises that can't be proven

## 🎨 Design System

### Light Mode Only - Clean & Premium

Our design philosophy focuses on:

- **Light mode exclusivity** - Clean, premium aesthetic
- **Subtle elevations** - Shadows instead of dark backgrounds
- **Strategic color use** - Color as highlight, not decoration
- **Consistent spacing** - 8px grid system
- **Smooth interactions** - Elegant transitions and feedback

### Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
- Primary: `#4f46e5` (Indigo) - Main actions
- Accent: `#f59e0b` (Amber) - Highlights, badges
- Success: `#059669` (Emerald) - Gains, savings
- Warning: `#d97706` (Amber Dark) - Alerts
- Danger: `#dc2626` (Red) - Losses, errors
- Info: `#0284c7` (Sky Blue) - Information

**Backgrounds:**
- Primary: `#ffffff` - Pure white
- Secondary: `#f8fafc` - Off-white, cards
- Tertiary: `#f1f5f9` - Hover states, inputs

**Text:**
- Primary: `#0f172a` - Titles, main text
- Secondary: `#475569` - Descriptions, labels
- Muted: `#94a3b8` - Placeholders, disabled

### Typography

- **Display & Body**: Inter
- **Monospace**: JetBrains Mono
- **Sizes**: 12px → 16px (base) → 48px (hero)

### Components

All components follow:
- Rounded corners (8px-24px)
- Subtle shadows
- Smooth transitions (200ms cubic-bezier)
