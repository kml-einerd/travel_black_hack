# Tone of Voice Guidelines

> Communication standards for MilesAI — Direct, Elegant, Honest, Empowering

---

## Core Philosophy

> **"Alternative path to the system. Real gains. Total independence."**

We are different because:
- ❌ We're NOT bank affiliates trying to push cards
- ❌ We have NO conflicts of interest in recommendations
- ✅ We put the USER first
- ✅ We show transparent calculations
- ✅ We admit when something isn't worth it

---

## The Four Pillars

### 1. Direct

**What it means**: Straight to the point, no fluff, respect the user's time.

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**: "This card doesn't make sense if you spend less than $3K/month on dining."

❌ **Bad**: "While this card offers an amazing array of benefits and could potentially be valuable in certain situations, it might not be the absolute best choice for every single person, especially those who..."

✅ **Good**: "Your redemption value: 1.8¢ per point. That's good value."

❌ **Bad**: "After conducting a comprehensive analysis of your redemption scenario and comparing it against industry benchmarks..."

**Guidelines**:
- Lead with the conclusion, then explain
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Cut unnecessary adverbs and qualifiers
- Active voice over passive voice

---

### 2. Elegant

**What it means**: Sophisticated but accessible. Never aggressive or hype-driven.

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**: "See how to maximize your return on spending"

❌ **Bad**: "EXPLODE YOUR POINTS BALANCE WITH THIS INSANE HACK!!!"

✅ **Good**: "This sweet spot offers exceptional value for premium travel."

❌ **Bad**: "This is literally the BEST deal EVER in the HISTORY of points!!!"

**Guidelines**:
- Avoid CAPS LOCK (except for acronyms)
- Avoid multiple exclamation marks
- Avoid exaggerated superlatives (amazing, incredible, unbelievable)
- Use precise language over dramatic language
- Maintain professional tone while being approachable

---

### 3. Honest

**What it means**: Admit limitations, uncertainties, and when we don't have all the answers.

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**: "This calculation is based on average values. Your actual value may vary depending on how you redeem."

❌ **Bad**: "This will definitely get you $10,000 in free travel!"

✅ **Good**: "We last verified this information on [date]. Terms may have changed."

❌ **Bad**: [Presenting old information as current without disclaimer]

✅ **Good**: "This strategy works best IF you can meet the requirements without changing your normal spending."

❌ **Bad**: "This strategy works for everyone, guaranteed!"

**Guidelines**:
- Always include update dates
- Specify when data is estimated vs confirmed
- Use conditional language when appropriate ("if," "typically," "in most cases")
- Acknowledge risks and downsides
- Never promise specific financial outcomes

---

### 4. Empowering

**What it means**: Make users feel intelligent and capable. Explain the "why," not just the "what."

**Examples**:

✅ **Good**: "You just discovered a sweet spot that 95% of people overlook. Here's why it works..."

❌ **Bad**: "Just do what we say and trust us."

✅ **Good**: "Now you understand the calculation, you can apply this framework to any redemption."

❌ **Bad**: "This is too complicated to explain, just follow these steps."

**Guidelines**:
- Explain the reasoning behind recommendations
- Show the math/calculations
- Teach frameworks, not just tactics
- Celebrate user insights and questions
- Encourage independent thinking

## Forbidden Words & Phrases

### Never Use These

```
❌ "Incredible" / "Fantastic" / "Amazing" / "Unbelievable"

```

### Why These Are Forbidden
- They're hyperbolic and undermine credibility
- They sound like scam marketing
- They create unrealistic expectations
- They're often legally problematic
- They conflict with our honest, direct philosophy

---

## Preferred Words & Phrases

### Use These Instead

```
✅ "Proven strategy" / "Data-driven approach"
✅ "Transparent calculation" / "Clear analysis"
✅ "Worth it IF..." / "Makes sense when..."

## Writing Formulas

### For Recommendations

**Template**:
```
[Recommendation] IF [condition].

Here's why: [Reasoning with data].

Consider: [Potential downsides or alternatives].
```

**Example**:
```
Use points for this booking IF you value them at less than 2.1¢ each.

Here's why: The flight costs $420 cash or 20,000 points + $25 in fees.
That's 1.98¢ per point [(420-25)/20000], which is above the baseline
cashback value of 1.0¢ but below transfer partner potential of 2.5¢.

Consider: If you have an upcoming trip to Japan, saving these points
for ANA First Class (2.7¢ value) might be better.
```

### For Educational Content

**Template**:
```
[Concept]

[Why it matters]

[How to use it]

[Example with real numbers]

[Common mistake to avoid]
```

**Example**:
```
Transfer Partners: Your Path to Premium Travel

Chase Ultimate Rewards and similar programs let you transfer points 1:1
to airline and hotel partners. This is where true value unlocks.

How it works: Instead of booking through Chase's travel portal at 1.25¢
per point, you transfer to United and book Polaris Business to Europe
for 70K points. That same ticket costs $3,500, giving you 5.0¢ per point.

Real scenario: Sarah needs NYC to London. Chase portal wants 280K points.
United wants 70K. Same flight. She saves 210K points by transferring.

Common mistake: Transferring before confirming award availability.
Transfers are usually one-way, so always search first, then transfer.
```

## Disclaimers & Legal Language

### When Required
- Financial outcomes are uncertain
- Affiliate links are present
- Data may be outdated
- Strategies have risks
- Individual results will vary

### How to Write Them

❌ **Bad** (kills momentum):
```
DISCLAIMER: The information provided herein is for educational purposes
only and should not be construed as financial advice. Individual results
may vary. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Consult
with a financial advisor before making any decisions. [300 more words...]
```

✅ **Good** (clear but concise):
```
Note: Values shown are estimates based on typical redemptions. Your
actual value will vary. Data last updated: January 14, 2026.
```

✅ **Good** (affiliate disclosure):
```
Transparency note: We may earn a commission if you apply through our
links. This doesn't affect our recommendations—we only feature cards
we'd personally use.
```

## Examples: Before & After

### Example 1: Card Recommendation

❌ **Before**:
```
The Chase Sapphire Preferred is an AMAZING card that offers INCREDIBLE
value! You'll earn a MASSIVE 75,000 point bonus and get UNLIMITED travel
benefits! This is the BEST card for EVERYONE!!! Click now before this
exclusive offer disappears!!!
```

✅ **After**:
```
The Chase Sapphire Preferred makes sense if you spend $4K+ in 3 months
without changing your normal habits. The 75K point welcome bonus is
worth approximately $1,500 when transferred to partners like United or
Hyatt. Best for frequent diners and travelers who value flexible points.

The $95 annual fee is offset by the $50 hotel credit and travel insurance
benefits if you travel twice per year. Not ideal for those who prefer
cash back or travel less than once per year.
```

### Example 2: Deal Alert

❌ **Before**:
```
INSANE DEAL!!! MUST ACT NOW!!! Amex Gold 90K HIGHEST BONUS EVER!!!
You'll NEVER see this again!!! FREE MONEY!!! CLICK HERE IMMEDIATELY!!!
```

✅ **After**:
```
Amex Gold: Increased 90K offer (up from typical 60K)

Worth approximately $1,800 based on typical transfer partner value of 2¢
per point. Requires $6K spend in 6 months.

The math: 90K points ($1,800) - $325 annual fee = $1,475 net first-year
value. Makes sense if you spend $500+/month on dining and groceries,
which earn 4X points.

Offer expires February 28. This is the highest public offer we've tracked
for this card in the past 18 months.
```

### Example 3: Award Booking Advice

❌ **Before**:
```
OMG you HAVE to book ANA First Class!!! It's LITERALLY the best thing
ever!!! FREE champagne! FREE caviar! You'll feel like a CELEBRITY!!!
BOOK NOW!!!
```

✅ **After**:
```
ANA First Class via Virgin Atlantic: High-value sweet spot

The numbers: 110K Virgin points round-trip US-Japan. Cash price
typically $12,000-15,000. That's 10.9-13.6¢ per point—exceptional value.

Transfer from Chase, Amex, Citi, or Bilt. Booking window opens 355 days
out. Availability is limited but consistent, especially departing Tuesday-
Thursday.

Consider: If you value comfort and experience over pure CPP calculations,
this is one of the best redemptions in the game. If you're optimizing
purely for distance traveled, business class gets you more trips.
```
